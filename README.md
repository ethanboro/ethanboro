Hi, I'm Ethan Boroditsky, a rising freshman at Duke studying math and computer science and am on the D1 varsity fencing team. I am currently taking classes in 
data structures and algorithms, machine learning, and proof based lenear algebra. I am currently exploring internship opportunities for a wide variety of fields, 
including finance, quant trading, computer science, and sustainable energy. I live in NJ/NYC area, but am flexible to relocate. My email is ethan.boroditsky@duke.edu, 
please feel free to reach out. 

My repos have projects from previous CS classes and internships.
